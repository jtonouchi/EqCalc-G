# Terms and Conditions

*Last Updated: February 6, 2026*

Welcome to this gaseous chemical equilibrium calculator app, EqCalc "the App". By downloading or using the App, you agree to the following Terms & Conditions. If you do not agree, please discontinue use.

## 1. Purpose of the App

The App provides on‑device gaseous chemical equilibrium calculations using publicly available scientific data and user‑provided datasets. It is intended for educational and general engineering reference purposes only.

## 2. On-Device Processing

All calculations are performed locally on your device. No calculation data, inputs, or results are transmitted off your device by the App.

## 3. Use of NIST and NASA Data

The App incorporates curve‑fit data derived from the following sources:

*	Risch, T. K. (2021). Curve fits of the NIST-JANAF thermochemical tables fourth edition (NASA/TM-20205003319). NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center. https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20205003319

*	Chase, M. W. (1998). NIST-JANAF Thermochemical Tables, 4th Edition. American Institute of Physics

**3a. Definitions**

*	**NASA** refers to the *National Aeronautics and Space Administration*, an agency of the United States government.

*	**NIST** refers to the *National Institute of Standards and Technology*, a U.S. federal agency.

**3b. Non-Endorsements**

NASA and NIST do **not** endorse this App, its developer, or any results produced by the App. Use of NASA and NIST data does not imply any certification, recommendation, or approval.

**3c. Warranty and Liability for NASA/NIST Data**

NASA and NIST provide their data "as‑is," without warranties of any kind. The App uses curve‑fit data from these sources, but neither NASA nor NIST is responsible for the accuracy, performance, or results of calculations performed within the App.

##4. User-Provided Data

You may upload your own thermochemical datasets for use within the App.

*	These datasets remain stored **only on your device**.

*	You are responsible for ensuring you have the rights to use any copyrighted or proprietary data you upload.

*	The App does not access, transmit, or store your datasets outside your device.

##5. Calculation Results and Errors

The App attempts to provide accurate calculations based on the selected models and data.
However:

*	All results are provided **without warranty**.

*	Calculations may contain errors due to numerical limitations, user‑provided data, or model assumptions.

*	You agree that the developer is not liable for any damages arising from incorrect or incomplete results.

##6. High-Risk Usage Warning

The App is **not** intended for use in high‑risk or safety‑critical engineering applications, including but not limited to:

*	Aerospace vehicle design

*	Combustion system certification

*	Industrial safety analysis

*	Any application where inaccurate thermochemical data could result in injury, property damage, or mission failure

You agree not to rely on the App as the sole source of engineering data for professional or safety‑critical decisions.

##7. Freemium Model and In-App Purchases

The App offers:

*	**Free version:** Fixed enthalpy and pressure equilibrium calculations.

*	**Plus version (non‑consumable purchase):** Additional calculation modes, including

	*	Fixed temperature and pressure

	*	Fixed entropy and pressure

	*	Fixed internal energy and volume

	*	Fixed temperature and volume

	*	Fixed entropy and volume

Purchases are processed through **RevenueCat**, which uses Apple’s in‑app purchase system.

##8. Restoring Purchases

If you reinstall the App or switch devices, you may restore your Plus upgrade:

	1. Open the App

	2. Navigate to **Info**

	3. Tap **Upgrade/Restore to Plus Version**

	4. Tap **Restore Purchase**

This uses RevenueCat and Apple’s App Store system to verify your previous non‑consumable purchase.

##9. Clipboard Usage

You may copy calculation results to your device’s clipboard and paste them into other apps. The App does not monitor or store clipboard contents.

##10. No User Accounts

The App does not create or require user accounts. No login, registration, or personal profile is used.

##11. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law:

*	The App is provided “as‑is.

*	The developer is not responsible for any damages, losses, or consequences arising from use of the App or reliance on its results.

*	You assume full responsibility for verifying results independently.

##12. Changes to These Terms

Terms may be updated periodically. Continued use of the App after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
